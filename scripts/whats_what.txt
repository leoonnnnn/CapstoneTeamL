TLDR: download extract_only_nodes.py and pdb2xyz.py and RUN extract_only_nodes.py



0. (optional) extract_full_backbone.py takes in a pdb files (just download one from PDB or EMDB) and spits out the sugar phosphate backbone as a pdb file

1. (required) extract_only_nodes.py can as a standalone script (OR using extract_full_backbone.py's output). inputs: EITHER a pdb file (download from PDB or EMDB). outputs: 3 files (phosphate and sugar nodes separately as pdb's and then together in a human readable text file)

2. (required*) pdb2xyz.py converts pdb files to xyz files


*extract_only_nodes.py imports pdb2xyz.py so you only need to have it downloaded and in the same folder as extract_only_nodes.py
